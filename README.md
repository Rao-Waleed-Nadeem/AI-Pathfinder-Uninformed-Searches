# AI Pathfinder – Uninformed Search Visualization

This project is a **GUI-based AI Pathfinder** built in Python using **Tkinter**.
It visually demonstrates **Uninformed Search Algorithms** on a grid.

## 📌 Algorithms Implemented

- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
- Depth-Limited Search (DLS)
- Iterative Deepening DFS (IDDFS)
- Bidirectional Search

## 🖥️ GUI Features

- Interactive grid
- Draw walls using mouse
- Place Start (S) and Target (T)
- Step-by-step animated visualization
- Real-time statistics (steps, explored nodes, path length)

## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.x  
  (No external libraries required)

> Tkinter comes **pre-installed** with Python.

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Open terminal in the project folder
2. Run the file:

```bash
python Q7.py
```
